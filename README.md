I have used NestJS to complete this task. For storing the data, I have used in-memory data storage (Map), ensuring fast and efficient data handling.

All CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations have been thoroughly tested using Postman, and I have ensured that they work seamlessly.

Features:
✅ Built with NestJS
✅ Uses in-memory data storage (Map)
✅ Fully tested with Postman
✅ Implements clean code practices

How to Run the Project:
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yared27/Leet_code_problems.git
Navigate to the project directory:
